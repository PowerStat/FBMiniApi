# PowerStat's FBMiniApi

This is a minimal Java implementation of the FritzBox AHA and TR64 APIs which will be extended by generated code.

See:

* [AVM Entwicklungssupport](https://avm.de/service/schnittstellen/)

## Installation

Because this library is only useful for developers the installation depends on your build environment.

For example when using Apache Maven you could add the following dependency to your project:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.powerstat.fb</groupId>
      <artifactId>miniapi</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Other build tools like gradle will work analogous.

To compile this project yourself you could use:

    mvn clean install org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage site
    
or simply:

     mvn clean install
     
To find newer dependencies:

    mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
    
To find newer plugins:

    mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
    
To make a new release:

    mvn --batch-mode release:clean release:prepare release:perform
    git push -â€“tags
    git push origin master

To run checkstyle:

    mvn checkstyle:check
    
To run pmd:

    mvn pmd:check
    
To run spotbugs:

    mvn spotbugs:check
    
To run arch-unit:

    mvn arch-unit:arch-test
    
To run JDeprScan:

    mvn jdeprscan:jdeprscan jdeprscan:test-jdeprscan
    
If you use [infer][https://fbinfer.com/]:

    infer run -- mvn clean compile
    
Run toolchain:

    mvn toolchains:toolchain

## Usage

For usage in your own projects please read the Javadoc's and follow the examples in the unittests.
Last but not least it would be better to use the full FB api that is based on this project and will be released separately.
